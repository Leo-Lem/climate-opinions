It made the Singapore PM then very concern as we were sorely reliant on Malaysia for our water supply and any water stoppage are national knee bending events. Our PM sought to fix our water sufficiency issues to remove the reliance on Malaysia. We remembered the Malaysians taunting us so hard when our leaders introduced the water recycling or NEWater plan as Singaporeans being so desperate they need to drink recycled pee or sewage water. That‚Äôs the kind of reaction they gave to us for our approach. Today, we are definitely thanking the Malaysians for their constant threat to turn the tap off because we are now more ready than many countries in managing water issues cause by climate change with a sustainable approach.",195

I saw the writing on the wall back in 2013 and relocated my family to the pacific northwest. My maternal grandfather practically raised me on stories of the dustbowl. By which I mean the actual event, not just the time period. He had to bury his dead baby sister who died from dustlung because his mother was also dying of dustlung as she gave birth, his Pa wasn&#39;t able to make it back to the ranch for over a month due to the conditions...The horses wouldn&#39;t have survived if forced to move during the storms. He lost several as it was even with them sheltering in the barns in Sante Fe. My grandpa was six at the time. Fucking six. We lost a lot of cattle that year, too. This was in rural new mexico.<br> So, yeah. It sucked. Grampaw told me stories of the dust clouds that reached impossibly high in the sky like a moving wall of death. Walls that <br>seemed to inch suddenly apearing on the horizon until it reached you, and then hit it you like a brick wall. blacking everything out and making it impossible to see without your eyeballs being sandblasted, couldn&#39;t breath without inhaling a bunch of sandy dirt.. He didn&#39;t have the word we do today to describe it, but they were haboobs. My family has a long memory.<br> When I saw small back to back haboobs in 2013  I  knew it was time to bug the fuck out. I convinced my wife we needed to GTFO if we meant to beat the flood of inevitably northbound climate refugees. <br>...Long story short, that&#39;s what we did. Now my extrended family have started to trickle after me in the past few years. Real estate here is starting to go through the roof. And the real migration push hasn&#39;t even really started yet. <br> The next sixty years or so will become known for a number of reasons as &#39;the great dying&quot;. Nor will it just be confined to the wild animal population. I fully expect the human cost to eventually tally into the billions before all Iis said &amp; done. We will survive as a species, but the world we know today will have vanished.  Replaced with what I cannot say. But those who are being born today and millenials will bear witness to one of the most tectonic shifts in earth&#39;s long history.<br> Even still, though we humans may have trigggered the severtity of the event when you step back and look at things with a long view, we&#39;re life&#39;s only shot at a ticket off this rock. At best earth&#39;s got what? Maybe half a billion years, maybe billion years tops before the magnetosphere pops or the sun starts to swell. Under either condition all life becomes impossible on this rock. It took three and a half billion years for just ONE species to arise capable of escaping, the chances of another arising in time to noah&#39;s ark this shit elsewhere is vanishingly thin. Nature will just have to cut us some slack on the heavy learning curve if she wants a ticket off this rock. Much as the hippies may scream about the enviroment, the hard reality is the clock was always ticking, whether we arose or not. The universe is not static. Life here was always going to die eventually. Only we humans provide it any slim hope it may be continued elsewhere. <br> Cheers.",140

To your question, &quot;What can we do?&quot;  My short answer is this: collectively, nothing that will matter much. Many of these tipping points are already happening, and our global climate has gone into a self-accelerating runaway heating and destabilization whose symptoms are everywhere. We&#39;re in for a rough ride that will only get rougher. Not much of a legacy for our children, I&#39;m afraid. <br>Individually is a different matter, however. We can grow gardens, grow community, and grow awareness, forming garden guilds within our own neighborhoods where we learn and teach how to grow our own food, share our equipment and skills, and steadily reduce our dependence on the larger infrastructures that are destroying our planet (e.g. fossil fuels, the money economy, rampant consumerism, etc.) And we can devote these skills to healing our landscapes and each other, practicing permaculture design, managing and recycling water, etc. This may not save us from the fate we have already locked in through our arrogance and greed, but it will make the remaining years less stressful and more convivial, and may even result in some of us actually surviving to start the long healing process thereafter.",86

When they rebuilt, all areas that had been flooded were off limits, and instead were turned into a public park with no permanent structures allowed. There are summer music and art concerts, and a walk / bike trail along the river. 50 years later, the river flooded again, but because they had learned, no lives and no property was lost.<br><br>We need to do the same everywhere.

This leads to wast areas being taken from the permafrost to the melted ground. Also we have found that rains and warm weather also drains lakes faster than previously thought.<br>2) Greenland ice sheet has most likely gone over its tipping point and will melt during next few centuries.<br>3) Arctic sea ice is getting thinner and arctic has heated 4 times faster than rest of the world. Partially tipped already. Like Barents sea is mostly ice free.<br>4) Forests like Amazon, boreal forests and many other have tipped at least part of the year to the state where it produces more carbon than what sinks there. We are losing too many forests that were a major carbon sink.<br>5) We are losing coral reefs already at record speed. 50% of the Great Barrier reef is dead and more bleeching events are coming almost every year. Almost all reefs has bleached at some level already.<br>6) Droughts. There are several areas in the world that are on going yearly droughts. Some have been under drought conditions for decades, some years and in this year many areas have been affect simultaniously. US west is on megadrought, Africa is on drought, mediterraneian area is on drought, Pakistan drought with extreme flooding, remember Australian wildfires, ...<br>7) Mountain glaciers are under tipping points in many areas. In Europe Alps are losing all glaciers and this year was one of the worst, yet. Rocky mountains in USA are losing glaciers, see &quot;glacier park&quot; that is losing its glaciers fast or what is happening to the Colorado river. Himalayas are losing some of its glaciers and main river are drying up. Andies are losing glaciers and some cities are threatened because there is no alternative water sources. Even places like Canada and Alaska are losing their glaciers. Swedens highest point was changed due to melting glacier. ...<br><br>You may add most of the animals to the mix if you want. But that&#39;s not only a climate issue. Sixth mass extinction needs its own talks.<br><br>Even with these on going tipping points, we still emit even more emissions this year. And likely next year.

Here is an excerpt from the writings of Marshall Vian Summers about how to respond to the signs the world is giving us about the changes that are already underway.<br>&quot;The world itself will tell you what is coming if you know how to read it and to discern its signs and messages. You do this without projecting any of your thoughts or fantasies or fears. You just watch and you listen, and piece by piece, the picture comes together. But to have this clarity of mind, you must be watching without coming to conclusions, without trying to tie things together, without trying to make them simple and comprehensible. Instead like building a puzzle, you allow the pieces to emerge and to fit together. This is called seeing. Most people do not see because they do not look with this emphasis. Impatient, they want conclusions...solutions...answers. They do not patiently wait ... allowing the picture to become clear. It is the same with hearing. You hear certain things, but instead of drawing conclusions or having these things reinforce your current assumptions and beliefs, you let them simply reside in your mind -- building. Let them instruct you...You must commit yourself to seeing and to hearing... For all of humanity now there is growing danger, and nature has equipped you to respond to it.&quot; (The Great Waves of Change, MVS)",20

A study of this by H. Hug from about 50 years ago using FTIR spectroscopy supports this view. Michel van Biezen also has a series of 4-minute YouTube lectures, Astronomy and the Atmosphere, that provide easily understandable information on this topic.<br><br>The absorption of infrared heat from the Earth‚Äôs surface by CO2 is most effective at a specific wavelength (14.97 micrometers). This absorption reaches a maximum, or becomes saturated, at relatively low CO2 levels (less than 100 parts per million) just meters from the earth‚Äôs surface. Beyond this concentration, adding more CO2 doesn‚Äôt significantly increase heat absorption because all the infrared (IR) radiation that CO2 can absorb is already being fully absorbed close to the Earth‚Äôs surface. This accounts for about 10 degrees Celsius of basic Greenhouse warming.<br><br>The speculation that CO2 can re-emit absorbed IR radiation into the upper atmosphere and cause further warming from CO2 conflicts with Beer‚Äôs ‚Äì Lambert‚Äôs Law and with the spectroscopy data that confirms the end point to absorption. Virtually all of the heat that CO2 can absorb is already accomplished. Other wavelengths of CO2 absorption, near 2, 3, and 4 micrometers, and even in the proposed wider band of 14.8 to 16 micrometers, excluding 14.97 of course, contribute very little to overall absorption.<br><br>Given these points, the focus on increasing CO2 levels and their catastrophic potential is greatly overemphasized. Instead, redirecting efforts to other effects CO2 might have, and investing in nuclear energy development would be a more effective use of resources.<br>Sincerely, Don Kloos, Chemist.",17

So the best bet is the climate of the East Mediterranean was changing (see Mesopotamia), a couple of freak natural disasters (see volcanoes and earthquakes), which led to mass migration, trade disruption and scarcity and became a feedback loop for unrest and war until practically no empire was left standing with the exception of Egypt, which historically has had a different climate compared to the rest of the Fertile Crescent with offset harvest seasons and a very reliable Nile.
